# DL_Coursera_Assignments
Python Assignments for the Deep Learning lectures by Andrew NG on coursera with complete submission for grading capability.

## Online Workspace
You can work on the assignments in an online workspace called <a href= "https://deepnote.com/">Deepnote </a>. This allows you to play around with the code and access the assignments from your browser.

## Tips
In numpy, the function dot is used to perform matrix multiplication. The operation '*' only does element-by-element multiplication (unlike MATLAB). If you are using python version 3.5+, the operator '@' is the new matrix multiplication, and it is equivalent to the dot function.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank professor AndrewNG and coursera for such an awesome course.
